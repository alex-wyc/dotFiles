\section{Background}
    As the years go by, millions of Americans are paying more and more for an undergraduate degree. Since 1978, the price of tuition and fees has increased by nearly 1225\%, twice the rate of growth of medical expenses and more than five times the growth rate of food expenses. [1] Americans begin to question the true value of college, whether or not it is really worth it to put down massive amounts of money to attend a private Ivy League university. \\
    There recently has been a large demand for careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). President Obama estimates a need for one million more STEM professionals than the U.S. will produce at the current rate. With the increasing innovation of technology, new advancements in medicine, and worldwide problems such as global warming and cancer, the STEM field needs more people than ever before. \\
    This has been a common problem for many years, that many reforms around the world have been made to allow people to get an undergraduate degree in the least costly manner. Germany has set the cap on tuition per semester to 500 euros (\$630 a semester) [3]. In the United States, however, President Obama has recently vowed to decrease the cost of a two year education in a community college to zero, in an effort to have Americans continue their education. What effect will this actually have on the future of the STEM field?
    

\section{Problem Restatement}
The potential of going through a STEM or non-STEM career can be answered through the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a model to determine how much a student will pay for an undergraduate degree.
    \item Develop a model contrasting the effects of getting a job with a STEM career or getting one with a different degree.
    \item Develop a ranking system/model that high school students could use to make decisions about their future.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Part 1: The Cost of College}

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The cost of attending college is only dependent on the cost of tuition, housing, and opportunity costs. This cost is only reduced by financial aid, scholarships, and working while studying.
    \item The tuition and housing costs of college stays constant over all four years.
    \item The financial aid and scholarship status of the students stays constant during the four years.
    \item The amount of financial aid a student receives is affected by two factors: The size of the student’s household and the household income.
    \item Assume that an undergraduate degree lasts for four years.
    \item We assume that the student is applying for financial aid through the college and the federal government.
    \item We assume that the applicant is a high school graduate attending college immediately following his or her graduation from high school.
    \item We assume that the student is a US citizen applying to college within the US.
    \item The median annual income for a full-time working person with only a high school degree is \$28,000 (2012 dollars) a year. [2] If we assume that someone who is not attending college enters the workforce, then the opportunity cost of attending college is \$28,000 (2012 dollars) per year.
    \item We assume that the survey result holds true on average.
    \item We assume that the size of a student’s scholarship is directly related to SAT score out of 2400. This is reasonable because in general, students who do well on the SAT tend to also be successful in academics in general. As a result, they are more likely to earn merit scholarships.
    \item We assume that the work study income is a function of seniority because of the experience gained by the students over the years and the student’s income increases at a constant rate each year.
    \item We assume that income taxes are the only taxes being paid for work study income.
    \item We assume that each student gets the maximum financial aid that he or she is eligible for.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design of the Model}
Based on assumptions 1, 2, 3, 10 and 11, we are able to create a formula for the cost of college that is only based on the variables mentioned, namely the size of the family, the total family income, the SAT score of the student and work study income. Out of these, only work study is a function of the number of years for which the student has been in college and the rest of the variables stay constant over 4 years. Thus, we express the sum of tuition and housing subtracting financial aid and scholarship as a constant function of time ($C$). It is affected solely by the household income, the size of the family, and the student’s SAT score. We create a function that is dependent on time ($y(t)$), which models the income that the student makes from working while in college. Based on data from MIT, On-campus Work study pays from a minimum of \$10 to \$20 per hour, with the lowest paying regular job being postering and the highest paying regular job being a TA (we disregard the job position as human test subject because it’s not a regular paying job). [5] We assume that the student works ten hours per day, and therefore, gets between \$100 and \$200 per week, that sums up to \$5,200 and \$10,400 per year. After income taxes, (10\% income tax for the first \$8,700, and 15\% income tax for the amount above \$8,700) the income becomes \$4680 to \$9275 after income taxes. [7] Therefore, the amount earned by work study is:
$$y(t) = P_i + \lfloor\frac{\Delta P}{3} \times (t-1)\rfloor$$
where $P_i$ is the initial pay (lowest) of the job and $\Delta P$ is the change in pay (supposedly positive) of the job, and $t$ is the number of years for which the student has been enrolled. \\
Assuming that the student moves up the income range at a linear rate, our model should look like this:

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Yicheng} \end{center}
\caption{Diagram of Cost of college vs The Grade of the Student}
\end{figure}

    To model the financial aid that the student will receive from FAFSA, we use a form that the government uses to determine the expected financial contribution (EFC) from a student’s family [6]. Because the formula takes into account many different aspects of a family’s financial situation, we only look at a few factors that have a major effect on the EFC. We assume that the total income of the family is equal to the sum of the incomes of the student’s parent(s). We also assume that the allowance against the parents’ income is determined by federal income taxes only. \\
This is a reasonable assumption because federal income tax is much higher than state or local income taxes and it greatly simplifies the model because every household pays federal income taxes, while state and local income taxes differ by location. Finally, we assume that the only assets that the student’s family has is savings. Most families do not have substantial investments or assets that are not their house so this assumption is somewhat accurate. Following the directions in the form with this simplified model gives the Adjusted Available Income (AAI) of a household to be roughly equal to \[ (\text{Household Income}) - (\text{U.S. Income Tax paid}) + (0.12)(\text{Savings})\]. We can then calculate the EFC, which is graduated and dependent on income, from Table A6 in [6].
    As shown by Table A6, the EFC is a piecewise function that depends on the AAI of a family.

\[
 EFC(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    -\$750 & \text{if } x < -\$3409 \\
    (0.22)(AAI) & \text{if } -\$3409 \leq x \leq \$15700 \\
    \$3454 + (0.25)(AAI - \$15700) & \text{if } \$15701 \leq x \leq \$19700 \\
    \$4454 + (0.29)(AAI - \$19700) & \text{if } \$19701 \leq x \leq \$23700 \\
    \$5614 + (0.34)(AAI - \$23700) & \text{if } \$23701 \leq x \leq \$27700 \\
    \$6974 + (0.40)(AAI - \$27700) & \text{if } \$27701 \leq x \leq \$31700 \\
    \$8574 + (0.47)(AAI - \$31700) & \text{if } x \ge \$31701 \\
  \end{cases}
\]

Maximum financial aid from FAFSA is determined by
\[(\text{Tuition}) - (\text{EFC})/(\text{\# of students attending college in the family}) \]
We assume that every student obtains the maximum amount of financial aid that he or she is eligible for.
Therefore, for each year, the cost would be: $A(t) = C - y(t)$
Therefore, the total cost of college ($C_{total}$) is:

\[
C_{total} = \int_1^4{C - y(t)}dt = 4 C - 3 P_i - (\lfloor \frac{\Delta P}{3} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{2 \cdot \Delta P}{3} \rfloor + \lfloor \Delta P \rfloor)
\]

Earning potential:

\subsubsection{Not all STEM degrees are created equal}
The overall U.S. Science \& Technology (S\&T) Workforce exceeded 7.4 million workers in 2012 and it will continue to grow significantly through 2018, to an estimated 8,654,000¹ STEM workers. ¹This number (8.65 million) does not reflect people who are “self-employed” in STEM fields. If “self-employed” is included, the number of people employed in STEM fields in 2012 is 14.9 million, and is projected to reach 15.68 million by 2018. Science \& Engineering occupations are projected to grow at more than double the rate (20.6\%) of the overall U.S. labor force (10.1\%) through 2018. These projections do not include occupations for which STEM degree holders use their STEM skills but are not considered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to be “strictly defined” STEM occupations. The total also includes individuals with STEM degrees as well as more than 1 million individuals with technical expertise and skills specific training who may not have formal STEM degrees. By 2018, the bulk of STEM jobs will be in Computing (71\%) followed by Traditional Engineering (16\%), Physical Sciences (7\%), Life Sciences (4\%) and Mathematics (2\%). [8]

\subsubsection{Part 2: STEM vs. non-STEM}

STEM and non-STEM careers have contrasting rewards and benefits. We first consider the average hourly salaries for different student jobs in STEM and non-STEM (based on data from MIT). [5]

\subsection{Justification and Testing of the Model}
We compare the estimated usage of fund provided by our $C_{total}$ with the actual spending of currently enrolled college students. We interviewed several college students using the following questionnaire:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which year of college are you currently in?
    \item How much have you spent on college per year?
    \item How much have you spent on college in total for the past few years?
    \item How much is your annual family income?
    \item How much do you earn from work study (if any)?
\end{enumerate}

Model: finding a job for STEM graduates versus non-STEM graduates.

Graduating with a degree won’t guarantee a job right away. We will calculate the expected time (in months) that a recent STEM graduate takes to find a job over the the expected time a non-STEM graduate takes.

Assumptions: 
We will begin our model in the month of May of one year and end in the May of next year. The reason is that most students will graduate college during that time period. Also, we will only be looking at jobs whose employment rates are not seasonally affected (Seasonally affected jobs, such as sales, do not meet the financial stability criteria of the contest prompt and thus will not be considered). \\
Define $J(t)$ as the total number of available job openings $t$ months from May of the first year. Also define $Q(t)$ as the total number of qualified workers looking for work (We assume a qualification threshold such that each “qualified” graduate has basically the same probability to getting a certain entry level job as any one of his/her peers). It is logical to assume that $Q(t)$ will only be decreasing over the 12-month period (since there are few new graduates after May). \\
The probability a graduate gets hired during any given month is proportional to the number of available job openings and inversely proportional to the number of the total number. We can express this probability as $\frac{kJ(t)}{Q(t)}$ (where $k$ is some constant). From our definition of $Q(t)$, the expected number of hires during one month is $kJ(t)$. So $Q(t)=Q(t-1)-kJ(t-1)$\\
For $J(t)$, we assume that the particular industry increases its number of entry-level job openings by a constant, $a$, each month. Then $J(t)=J(t-1)+a-kJ(t)$.\\
Now let us define $P(t)$ as the probability that a certain individual who graduated in May of the first year gets a job during the $t$th month after graduation. In order to get a job during the $t$th month, the individual cannot have gotten a job during any of the previous months. Thus $P(t)=\frac{kJ(t)}{Q(t)} \displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{t-1} (1-P(i))$. Therefore, for any worker who gets a job within the first year after graduation, the expected number of months they took to receive \\

We will utilize the following employment projections compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compute our $a$(http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/article/pdf/occupational-employment-projections-to-2022.pdf) and we will use current graduation numbers as our $J 
 


We will run the model with assuming that half the number of

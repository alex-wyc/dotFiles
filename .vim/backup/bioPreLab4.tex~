    \item Why are green plants considered to be the ancestors of land plants?

        Because green algaes were the first to develop chlorophyll-based
        photosynthesis which is found in plants today, green algaes also have
        similar cell-wall structure as do modern plants. They also both store
        food as starch and share many other common traits.

    \item What two adaptations were necessary for these photosynthetic algae to
        make the transition from aquatic (water) to terrestrial (land) habitats?

        The vascular and root system allowed land based plants to efficiently
        find, transport and store water in a relatively dry environment. The
        development of the curticle in plants as a protective layer also allows
        plants to better retain water and survive on a harsher environment.

    \item Create a table or answer in complete sentences. For each of the 4
        organisms we will be observing today, identify: the life cycle, habitat,
        reproductive method, mode of digestion, and taxonomic classification (Kingdom,
        Phylum and Class).

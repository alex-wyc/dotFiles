            <h2>What is a CTF?</h2>
            As the creators of <a href="https://picoctf.com/">picoCTF</a> put it, 
            <blockquote>
                CTFs (short for capture the flag) are a type of computer security competition.
                Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity,
                technical (and googling) skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually
                cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string
                (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service. CTFs are a
                great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal
                environment, and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world
                for fun and practice.

            <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
            This CTF is designed for computer science students at Stuyvesant
            High School. The difficulty level of challenges ranges from easy to
            difficult, so there is something to test both the introductory
            computer science student as well as the advanced one. Those who are
            not students at Stuyvesant High School are encouraged to compete as
            well, but will not be eligible for prizes. The goal of this CTF is
            to introduce students, especially those in introductory computer
            science courses or first-time CTF-ers, to basic computer security and problem-solving
            skills that will prove valuable in further computer science
            education, in addition to life in general.
            <h2>What constitutes cheating in this competition?</h2>
            Our rules are the same as in picoCTF,
            <blockquote>
                Attacking the scoring server (e.g. by brute-forcing), other teams,
                or machines not explicitly designated as targets is cheating. This
                includes both breaking into such machines and denying others access
                to them (for example, by altering a key or ping-flooding).  Sharing
                keys or providing overly-revealing hints with other teams is
                cheating, as is being directly assisted by personnel outside the
                team (using tools from the internet is OK; asking people on the
                internet to help you solve the problem is not). We encourage you to
                solve problems in novel and creative ways using all available
                resources, but we do require that you solve them yourselves.

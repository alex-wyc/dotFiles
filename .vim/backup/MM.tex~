As a high school student slowly moving into maturity, it is important
for me and others to start to consider our life choices regarding financial
security. In order to make the right choices, one must first understand
some important definitions and facts. First of all one one needs to understand
the definition of financial security. Financial security is the state of
controlling one's monetary conditions. For example, one should avoid/keep track
of one's credit card and bank account informations. It is also important to
split one's wealth in smart investments, business and bank account. It is also
a good idea to start planning out one's life as early as possible. As a high
schooler, I am planning out my life, with possible college spending, work study, etc.

For example, when purchasing a video game, it is important to not only act on
interest, but one should also consider one's economic condition and other things as
well.

\subsubsection{Educate the next generation}

Similar to what happens in many other fields, the younger generation
approaches the matter of financial security with a "I'll handle it when
it comes up." However, in the financial world, some things are too serious
to risk. For example, a credit trap is potentially fatal to one's financial
career.

\section{\underline{Young and Restless in China} -- Money and Health Case Study}

In this documentary we see the life of many young Chinese and how their life
decisions are affected by the availability of money. We see that in a lot of
cases, people treat money and wealth as quantifiers of success and ability. This
is a harmful attitude because it often times lead to low self-esteem and
depression in young people. After all, even if they are very talented, they
didn't have enough time to accumulate their wealth yet, but the strong desire of
money causes them to have lower self-esteem and may even lead to serious
depression. On the other hand, this also causes young people to take risks and
becoming entrepreneurs. Like we saw in the video with the programmer, he used to
have a stable job earning a salary, but the desire of money caused him to switch
to the online custom-made shirt-selling industry.

To investigate the reason behind this, it is first necessary to understand why
society treats money with such a high priority. In the modern capitalistic
world, in many ways the amount of money one earns defines the baseline of
"acceptable living conditions." Because under the world of high specialization,
people don't grow their food themselves anymore, but rather buys food from other
specialized farmers. This explains why the modern world is so money-centered and
why "the good life" is often associated with having lots of money. In fact,
because of modernized globalization, capitalism and materialism has spread
through much of the world and very few cultures (like the North Koreans) are still immune to the
influence of capitalism and materialism.

\subsection{Capitalism and History in China}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}

In the specific case of China, its history and traditions also plays a large
role in the spreading materialistic ideal. In Mao's time, the perception of
wealth and money to an average Chinese person was that it was something one
should get rid of, that all properties are thefts. However, that economic policy
didn't fare very well and many starved. Then along comes Deng and his economic
reforms. His reforms introduced capitalism to Chinese culture and society. Young
people, who were not around for the political education of their elderlies were
sick and tired of their poor living conditions and became the vanguards of
Chinese capitalism. Along with the praise of capitalism, however, comes the
praise of western society and ideals and brands. In China sometimes people
idolize the west and all of its belongings. This is why brands are very
important to Chinese, it's not only a display of wealth but also of taste and
ideals.

\subsection{Influence of Traditions and Culture}
However, the influence of Chinese traditions also plays a vital role in the
desire for money present in many young Chinese. For example, the concept of
filial piety contribute to the desire for money in many young Chinese. In China,
taking care of the elderly is a \textbf{moral obligation.} So that puts
pressures on young people to not only work hard for themselves but also to
support their family members. And to do so young people often seek advice from
Confucius ideals and traditions, which are often centered around hard work and
dedication.

However, not all traditions promote economic growth. For example, the traditions
for women to fulfill ``womanly duties," i.e. get married and take care of the
family is dragging back the economic capability of many bright young girls who
are forced to marry early due to traditions.

\section{Specific Economic Case Study -- China}
In China's booming economy, it is easy for all kinds of people to find jobs that
suit their abilities, be it manual labor or advanced engineering. And in terms
of workforce, the elite of China are not yet entrenched enough in their wealth
to simply give up working. In terms of this, everyone in China works. The
Chinese currency is the Chinese Yuan, or sometimes referred to as RMB, which is
the abbreviation of ``People's Currency" in Chinese. The exchange rate of the
Yuan and the dollar is approximately 6 to 1, this number, however, has been
dropping for the past few years.

The level of education in China, like many other things, shows a huge
discrepancy between the well-educated and the under-educated. However, this
trend is changing rapidly. As we can see in the below figure, the average level
of education of China has been steadily rising ever since the 1998.

In terms of sanitation, China once again is presented with discrepancy between
the well-off and the not-well-off. However, the gap is not nearly as huge as the
discrepancy of wealth. Most, if not all of China has connections to public
services such as hospitals, government provided food, and clean water.

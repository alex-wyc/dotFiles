    <h1>Different Types of Cancer</h1>
    Cancer is not a specific disease that attacks a specific tissue/organ.
    Rather it is a condition that can attack any part of the body. With different
    types of cancer attacking different parts of the body there are different
    symptoms. The following chart shows the symptoms and signs of different types
    of cancers.

    <h1>General Signs and Symptoms</h1>
    Cancer usually starts off with a gene mutation that causes a cell to divide uncontrollably. Depending
    on the area, the early symptoms may be miniscue. In other areas, such as the brain, even a small tumor
    can cause severe symptoms.
    <br><br>
    Symptoms of cancer can take on many different forms. But the general symptoms are similar. The tumor grows
    and suppresses blood vessels and nerves. These are usually the first symptoms of cancer. For example, the
    suppression of nerves can cause pain in the affected area, like chest pain for lung cancer, etc.
    <br><br>
    If the cancer begins in some place with a lot of nerve endings, such as ovarian cancer, early detection is
    relatively easy. However, for some cancer like the pancratic cancer, symptoms don't show until the cancer
    cells begin to spread.
    <br><br>
    Other symptoms of early stage cancer involves fever, weight loss, fatigue, etc. This is because cancerous
    cells direct energy away from the body to the cancerous cells.

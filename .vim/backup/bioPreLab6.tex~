\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe the general structure of the hemoglobin macromolecule.

        A hemoglobin macromolecule has a quaternary structure similar to many of
        the multi-subunit globular proteins. The macromolecule is composed of 4
        myoglobin subunits arranged in a roughly tetrahedral fashion around a
        heme group.

    \item How does sickle hemoglobin differ in structure from normal hemoglobin?

        Usually the structure of a hemoglobin is very flexible and allows red
        blood cells to be flexible. However, the structure of a sickle
        hemoglobin lacks the flexibility and get stuck in the blood vessels.

    \item Describe the difference between autosomal and sex linked diseases. Is sickle cell an
        autosomal or sex linked disease?

        Sex linked diseases are diseases that are transferred via the sex
        chromosomes, so if one parent has the disease the child also has the
        disease. Autosomal diseases are transferred via the somatic
        chromosomes. So the child will only receive the disease if both parents
        have the disease. sickle cell is an autosomal disease.

    \item What specific mutation causes sickle-cell disease?

        The sickle-cell disease is caused by the mutation within chromosome 11
        that governs the development of beta bonds.

    \item Describe how the mutation manifests in protein structure and affects cell function.

        The mutation changes a crucial structural characteristic of the
        hemoglobin -- its flexibility. This affects its function by inhibiting
        it from moving in the blood vessels.

    \item What causes the symptoms of sickle-cell disease and how is it treated?

        The inability to deliver oxygen to crucial organs such as the spleen,
        liver, kidneys, heart, etc. causes the symptom of the disease. Without
        oxygen, the cells at the affected organs die.

        Another side effect is that sickle cells die faster than red blood
        cells so the total count of red blood cells is also lower than healthy
        levels.

        A third effect is the clotting of the blood vessels as a result of all
        the red blood cells that are stuck in there. This causes episodes of
        pain called crises.

        The treatment of the disease involves intake of antibiotics against
        infections, folic acids to help build more red blood cells, and good
        rest, hydration and avoiding strenuous physical activities.

    \item What is the life expectancy rate in those who have sickle cell disease? Compare the
        likelihood of survival in areas such as the United States versus underdeveloped countries.

        Due to the availability of treatment and medications, the average life
        expectancy of patients within the US is around 45 years. However, the
        situation in underdeveloped countries is much worse, with infantry
        death rates as high as 60-80\%.

    \item What is the frequency of the sickle cell disease in the United States?

        Sickle cell disease affects an estimated 90,000 - 100,000 Americans.

    \item What causes malaria and how is it contracted? Describe the pathogen and its life cycle. You
        may use a diagram if you choose.

        Malaria is a parasite that invades two hosts, the female mosquito and
        humans. It has alternation of generations, it spends its sporophyte
        stage of life within the female mosquito and injects its gametophyte
        inside the human blood as the mosquito takes a bite. Then the
        gametophyte invades first the liver and then the red blood cells,
        causing them to die. The gametophyte will then move on into the
        mosquito when it takes a bloody bite.

    \item What are the symptoms of malaria and how is it treated?

        Malaria can be categorized into uncomplicated and complicated malaria.
        Uncomplicated malaria has the symptoms of fever, headache, sweats,
        chills, nausea, and body ache. While severe malaria has symptom
        including impaired consciousness, severe anemia, acute respiratory
        distress syndrome, acute kidney failure, etc.

        Current treatment is mainly centered around the usage of anti-parasite
        antibiotics, which does a pretty good job killing the parasite.

    \item What is the relationship between sickle-cell disease and malaria? Please include any data
        that you may find and remember to cite your sources.

        It is fairly interesting how sickle-cell mechanism is actually a
        defense against malaria. The sickle trait makes red blood cells a lot
        less susceptible to the invasion of the malaria-causing-parasite.
        However, if both parents have the sickle trait, then the child receives
        sickle-cell disease.

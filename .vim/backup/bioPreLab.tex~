\subsection{Natural History}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What structure do all vertebrates share in common?

        All vertebrates have what is called the vertebral column, or the spine. It is
        a skeletal structure that also serves as an integral part of the
        autonomous nervous system.

    \item What does the term `amphibian' mean, and why is it a proper
        classification for frogs?

        Amphibians are identified by their fish-like embryos and their
        metamorphosis when growing up, they also use their skin as an
        air-exchange surface. These are all characteristics of a frog and
        therefore frogs are amphibians.

\subsection{External Anatomy}

    \item Is it easy to tell a male and female frog apart? Explain.

        It is very difficult to tell from an external appearance if the frog is
        male or female because their outside anatomy look mostly the same.

    \item What important function does the frog’s skin perform?

        The skin functions as the frog's respiratory surface alongside the lung.

    \item How are the positions of the frog’s eyes different from that of a
        human, and why is this advantageous (or good) for the frog?

        Unlike humans, frogs are not on top of the food chain, so they need to
        look out for possible predators. Having eyes on their sides gives them a
        wider vision whereas the human eye positioning gives humans a more
        focused vision that aids in hunting.

    \item What is the function of the tympanic membranes, and which human
        structures are they most similar to?

        The tympanic membranes transfer sound-waves into the inner ear of the
        frog and is used for sound detection. It is similar to human eardrums.

    \item Why are forelimbs smaller and less muscular than the hind legs?

        Because the hind legs of the frog are used for jumping, swimming, and
        other high-intensity functions, therefore it requires more muscle power
        and is therefore more muscular.

    \item What do muscles found in the frog’s upper leg move?


    \item What do muscles found in the frog’s lower leg move?

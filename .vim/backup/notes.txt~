on lucas

on his feelings in general - w.t.f. does that even mean -> they obviously still like each other just b/c you caused enough trouble for them to "break up" doesn't mean you get the right to monopolize ruo

on hating ethan talking to ruo - so like jealousy taken to the extreme --> after they break up they can't be friends after breaking up...
continued - you're the idiot 3rd party here, why the f**k do you feel so justified?

on ethan hating him - w.t.f. do you f**king expect, you literally rekt his relationship... -_- this kid, classical white kid... so self-centered

ON RUO AND AYUMI -- THAT'S HIS F**KING FAULT. HE F**KED UP, NOW DEAL WITH IT...
WEAK TIMID FOOL of a man -- sidenote: remember how prison is too chillax? WELL? Losers deserve their place

On the unclean breakup -- FOR WHAT THE F**K REASON DOES HE THINK HE DESERVE AN
EQUAL CHANCE?!?!? ETHAN GOT THERE FIRST... ETHAN WAS THERE FOR RUO FOR 1.5
YEARS... WHAT DO YOU THINK GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO JUST SWOOP IN?!?!? WHO THE F**K
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?!?!?!?!
    1. YOU ARE INTERVENING A PERFECTLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP --> YOUR FAULT WE'RE IN
        THIS MESS
    2. ETHAN HONESTLY CARES ABOUT RUO AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU DO YOU STUPID
        IDIOT. THINK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE FOR ONE MOMENT
    3. YOU HONESTLY DESERVE NO RIGHT TO EVEN BE SPEAKING RIGHT NOW... IF I WERE
        ETHAN YOU'D BE DEAD BY THIS POINT IN TIME

Breakup with Ayumi Part II -- ok honestly, this was lucas' call... He decided to
break up with Ayumi... So he has to deal with it... Q.E.D.
    - NOW GO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR STUPIDITY

Breakup "should" work -- huh? W.T.F. dude? Breakup is supposed to be the
decision of RUO AND ETHAN, YOUR F**KING INVOLVEMENT MADE THIS BREAKUP AS
ILLEGITEMATE AS IT GETS --> refer to previous points... So I really don't
understand why you feel justified


on eth
i can imagine... I would too. This goon rekt eth's relationship and thinks he's justified and deserves ruo... ofc eth would want to punch him.

not those

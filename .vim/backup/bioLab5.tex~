\section{Purpose}
To study the anatomy of the reproductive system in plants, which consists of the
flower and the fruit/seed.

\section{Background Information}
Plants, unlike animals, have a unique way of reproducing. Without the ability to
move, plants utilize other animals to spread the sperm to other plants. However,
it is still a good way to study how organisms reproduce sexually.

\section{Prelab Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare and contrast angiosperms to gymnosperms.

        Angiosperms are gametes that are covered within an ovary, usually a
        fruit, whereas gymnosperms are exposed on the surface.

    \item The flower attaches to what part of the plant?

        It is attached to the receptacle, which is the thickened part of the
        stem.

    \item Why are flowers brightly colored?

        They are that way to attract insects to pollinate them.

    \item The female reproductive structures are called the:

        The female reproductive structures are called the ovary.

    \item Name the three parts of the pistil:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Stigma -- receives pollen
            \item Style -- tube on top of the ovary
            \item Ovary -- female reproductive organ
        \end{itemize}

    \item Where are the ovules stored?

        They are stored within the ovary.

    \item Name the two parts of the stamen:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Anther -- produces and contains pollen
            \item Filament -- provide support for the anther
        \end{itemize}

    \item Describe sexual reproduction in plants.

        The male part of the flower produces pollen, which is spread via some
        means (usually insects) to the stigma of the female part of another
        plant. Then the fertilized ovules develop into seeds.

    \item The ovary develops into what structure and why does this occur?

        The ovary eventually develops into the fruit body of the plant. This
        occurs to ensure protection and nutrition for the developing seed.

    \item Some flowers are not brightly colored at all, but have a very pungent odor
that smells like rotting meat. How do you think these flowers are pollinated?

        These flowers attract specific insects that prey on rotting meat to
        pollinate. The smell attract the meat-consuming insects and aids
        pollination.

    \item In many flowers, the pistils and stamens reach maturity at different times.
Considering what you know about pollination, why would this be an advantage to the plant?

        This is very important in prevent self-pollination. Since otherwise the
        flower may pollinate itself and lose the advantage of sexual
        reproduction.

    \item How are fruits useful to plants?

        Fruits serve as protection and nutrition base for the seed of the plant.

    \item How is a BERRY different from a DRUPE? Describe and give an example of each.

        Berries are fruits that has soft fruit body and usually carry several
        seeds, such as the apple. While drupes are fruits that has 1 seed
        enclosed within a hard shell, such as the peach.

    \item Describe what occurs when a seed germinates. What environmental conditions
are needed to begin the germination process?

        Germination is the beginning of the development of a seed. Several
        environmental conditions are needed to begin this process, but usually
        this process begins when there's a change in environment, such as a
        change in location, a wildfire, etc. But they can usually be classified
        as change in temperature, water and light conditions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What features of the flower you observed today would indicate its
        method of pollination? Explain.

        The male part of the flower (stamen) has the pollen part on top, which
        facilitates insects to get the pollen from the flower. Then the pistil has a
        long opening so that insects can easily pollinate the flower.

    \item Based on what you observed today, describe how the structure of the
        female and male organs determine their function.

        The stamen is pretty tall, with the anther, which contains the pollen,
        this is supported by the filament, which facilitates insects to get the
        pollen. The style is even taller than the filament, which makes it easy
        for the insects to drop off the pollen, and the ovary is the largest
        part which makes sense because it will eventually develop into a fruit.

    \item What color did you observe after adding the iodine to the inside of
        the seed? What does that indicate about the food contents of the seed
        for the developing embryo?

        The seed turned black when iodine is added to the inside of the seed.
        This shows that the seed has high concentration of starch, which is the
        energy source for the developing embryo.

    \item Compare the structures in the apple and tomato. How do these fruits
        differ from the pea pod?

        These fruits differ from a pea pod in that the apple and the tomato are
        what used to be ovaries and they surround the seeds with flesh for
        development and have radial symmetry. The pea pod however, is an
        elongated structure with a few naked seeds.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
The lab went well, the dissection of the flower and pea and fruits all went
well. However,the pea was more brittle than expected and a little part broke
off. Apart from that the lab went according to plan.

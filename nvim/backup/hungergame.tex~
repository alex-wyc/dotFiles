\section*{Introduction}
In our modern world, the choice of food are virtually infinite. With the
development of agriculture and domestication, most of humanity no longer need
to dedicate the majority of their lives in search for food. However, with more
food comes more choices and it is very important to understand which ones are
healthy and which ones are not.

\section{FAD Diets}
Fad diets usually advocate for absurd dietary conditions, either the type of
food or the amount of food, to achieve unreasonable weight loss in short period
of time. Most of the time, fad diets do work in the short term but are very bad
for the person, both health-wise and weight-wise in the long run.

\subsection{Special Case Study -- Fruitarianism}

This is the belief that one should only eat "fruits." Reasons for following this
type of diet varies from people to people, including from environmental, relgious,
cultural, asthetic, economic and health reasons. The strict definition of what
is considered "fruitarian" also varies on a case-by-case basis, some people make
it their duties to survive on a diet of 75\% fruits, while others believe that
the diet should be composed of solely fruits. There are also various
interpertations of what food can be eaten. While some believe that fruits involve
grains and fruits, while others believe that it should be fruit-only. Even then
there are disagreements over the definition of the word "fruit." Some believe it
involves the seeds of plants while others believe that it only contain the juicy
parts of the fruit. There are also debates regarding the allowance of nuts in a
fruitarian diet. But the general idea is that the majority of the diet is
composed of fruits.

Health-wise, while some believe that this is a very healthy way of living, it is
actually very, very dangerous. For one to survive, one need a healthy intake of
fat, carbohydrates and proteins, whereas in a fruitarian diet, there is an
absurdly high intake of carbohydrates and almost no fats nor proteins and a
lacking of some important vitamins and minerals. Fruitarians usually suffer from
difficiencies of vitamin B-12, D, calcium, zinc, iodine and omega-3 fatty acids.
The overdose of carbohydrates also puts extreme pressure on the pancreas, which
is tasked with blood carbohydrate regulation and the liver, which is tasked with
carbohydrate digestion. In fact, one of the most famous fruitarians, Mr. Steve
Jobs, the CEO of Apple died from pancreas cancer, and to a large extent his
death can be attributed to his fruitarian diet.


\section{Food Study}
In our modern society, there are a lot of choices of food, each with distinct
origins and health benefits. Below offers case studies of two popular Chinese
foods -- Dumplings and Tofu to study their history and health values.

\subsection{Dumplings}

Dumpling is perhaps the most iconic Chinese food, and with all iconic foods of a
culture, there really isn't a strict definition of the food, but the general
idea is that it's a piece of dough wrapped around some form of meatball.
However, the actual content does not have to be composed or even involve meat,
it can be composed of purely vegetables, or a combination of both. According to
folklores, during Han dynasty, the famed physician Zhongjing Zhang invented the
dumpling during the Han dynasty to treat hunger in his home town. The dumpling
is very easy to make and is pretty nutritious as well. The dough provides some
carbohydrates and what is put inside the dough really determines the nutritional
value. The food is prevalent all over China and has became\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\textwidth}

Chinese food to foreigners and is sold in literally every Chinese restaurant
ever. The dumpling is usually by itself a main course in most Chinese
restaurants and is not incorporated into any other dishes.

\subsection{Tofu}

Tofu, in short, is coagulating soy milk cut into rectangular pieces. Tofu was
invented by the Chinese chemist Liu An in an unsuccessful attempt to create
elixir during the Han Dynasty. (He is also attributed with the advancement of
fire powder, while trying to invent elixir). The food is very widespread and has
became an essential part of Chinese (if not Asian) cuisine. Tofu is very
appealing due to its nutritional value, taste and accessibility. Tofu is not a
part of the traditional western menu, but it does have to be eaten with
utensils, usually spoons or chopsticks. Tofu and the process of making it varies
from place to place, with different concentration of soy milk that induces
different "firmness."

\subsubsection{Mapo Tofu}
This dish is especially popular in the Sichuan province in China. The dish is
very simple to make, one simply cut the tofu into small rectangular pieces and
pan-fried with minced pork, vegetables and chili oil.

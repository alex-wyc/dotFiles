\section{Purpose}
To study the life cycle and reproduction of various protists and fungi.

\section{Background Information}
In this lab we study the lifestyle, habitat and reproduction of several protists
and fungi. Those are two important kingdoms, with unique and interesting
charastics such as the ability to photosynthesis, and to reproduce both sexually
and asexually.

\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Put the slide onto the observation deck.
    \item Use the coarse adjustment knob to move the slide into focus
    \item Switch to high power lens and sketch the slide.
    \item Repeat with all slides.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Prelab Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why are green plants considered to be the ancestors of land plants?

        Because green algaes were the first to develop chlorophyll-based
        photosynthesis which is found in plants today, green algaes also have
        similar cell-wall structure as do modern plants. They also both store
        food as starch and share many other common traits.

    \item What two adaptations were necessary for these photosynthetic algae to
        make the transition from aquatic (water) to terrestrial (land) habitats?

        The vascular and root system allowed land based plants to efficiently
        find, transport and store water in a relatively dry environment. The
        development of the curticle in plants as a protective layer also allows
        plants to better retain water and survive on a harsher environment.

    \item Create a table or answer in complete sentences. For each of the 4
        organisms we will be observing today, identify: the life cycle, habitat,
        reproductive method, mode of digestion, and taxonomic classification (Kingdom,
        Phylum and Class).

            \textbf{Reproductive Method} & \textbf{Mode of Digestion} &

            \textit{Spirogyra spp.} & Alternating Haploid and Diploid cycles & Fresh water & Both asexual and sexual &
            Photosynthesis & Plante, Chlorophyta, Zygnematophyceae \\\hline
            \textit{Volvox spp.} & Alternating Haploid and Diploid cycles & Fresh Water & Both asexual and sexual &
            Photosynthesis & Plante, Chlorophyta, Chlorophyceae \\\hline
            \textit{Rhizopus spp.} & Alternating Haploid and Diploid cycles & Organic substances & Asexual and Sexual
            spores & Extracellular breakdown + absorption & Fungi, Zygomycota,
            Mucormycotina \\\hline
            \textit{Agaricus spp.} & Alternating Haploid and Diploid cycles & Soil rich with organic materials &
            self-mated sexual reproduction & Absorb nutrients from the soil &
            Fungi, Agaricomycotina, Agaricomycetes \\\hline

\section{Postlab Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe what happened to the pyrenoid bodies in Spirogyra spp. when
        you added Lugol’s Iodine Solution to them. Explain the importance of
        pyrenoid bodies to algal survival.

        The pyrenoid body is the main starch storage compartment within the
        Spirogyra. When Lugol's solution is added, the pyrenoid bodies are
        especially stained. Starch is the energy storage molecule for Spirogyra.
        Therefore it is necessary for its survival.

    \item Based on your observations of Spirogyra spp., what is the function of
        the conjugation tubes? Does this represent sexual or asexual reproduction?
        Justify your answer.

        The conjugation tube is a way of sexual reproduction for the Spirogyra.
        Using the conjugation tubes, the male cytoplasm migrates over and forms
        a zygote.

    \item Based on your observations, define Volvox spp. as a colonial organism.
        What does this suggest about the evolutionary event between unicellular
        algae and multicellular organisms?

        Volvox is a very fascinating organism. It is a colonial organism, where
        there are some specialization near the head of the colony. This may
        suggest that multicellular organisms first evolved from communities of
        single cell organisms.

    \item Based on your observations of organisms in today’s lab, explain how
        mold obtains nutrients even if they grow in dark, moist areas. Name the
        structure they use to obtain nutrients.

        Mold don't need to photosynthesis to get nutrients. In fact, they are
        parasitic. They get their nutrients by secreting enzymes onto the
        substrate and intaking the predigested nutrients.
    
    \item When you observed the mushroom section, you should have seen spores
        along the gills. What is the purpose of a basidiospore, and is it diploid
        (2n) or haploid (1n)?

        They are haploid cells, they are in fact gamates used to reproduce for
        the mushroom.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

For the most part the lab went well, except we by accident stained the Volvox
colony with Lugol's solution, which killed the colonies. But apart from that the
lab went well.

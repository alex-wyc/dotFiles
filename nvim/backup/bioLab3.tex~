\section{Purpose}
To study the internal anatomy and structure of the internal of a frog -- the
typical vertebrate.

\section{Background Information}
The frog is often called the "typical" vertebrate due to many of its qualities
being widespread among the vertebrates. Frogs themselves are amphibians and have
special adaptations to their unique semi-aquatic lifestyle such as their skin,
which functions as a gas-exchange surface. However, most of the frog's anatomy
is generic to mostly all vertebrate and a study of the frog gives a good
understanding of the basic structure of a vertebrate.

\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the frog's mouth and remove its tongue.
    \item Position the frog ventral side up.
    \item Use the dissection scissors to cut the skin horizontally from shoulder
        to shoulder.
    \item Use the scissors to cut the skin horizontally from thigh to thigh.
    \item Use the scissors to cut the skin vertically down the center of the
        frog.
    \item Use the scissors to cut the ventral muscle in the same manner,
        exposing the insides.
    \item Use the tweezers to remove the fat bodies and the oviducts.
    \item Use the tweezers to remove the livers and the heart.
    \item Remove the lungs and the gallbladder.
    \item Remove the entire coelom with the scissors and identify the pancreas,
        the kidneys, the spleen and the testes.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Prelab Questions}
\subsection{First Cut}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item When dissecting the frog do you start with the ventral or dorsal side
        up?

    We start with the frog ventral (stomach) side facing up.

\subsection{Digestive System}
    \item Name and describe at least 4 organs in the digestive system.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pancreas: the gland that secrets most of the digestive enzymes for
            the small intestine.
        \item Liver: Secretes bile to emulsify fat.
        \item Stomach: where food mix with digestive enzyme and some digestion
            of fat and protein occurs.
        \item Small intestine: where most of the chemical digestion/absorption occurs, with
            the aid of digestive enzymes from the stomach and pancreas.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Respiratory System}
    \item What organ connects the lungs to the mouth?

    Glottis is the tube that connects the lungs to the mouth of a frog.

    \item Frogs use which two organs to exchange gases?

    Frogs use their skin and lung to exchange gases.

\subsection{Circulatory System}
    \item What are the 3 types of blood vessels?

    The three types of blood vessels are: arteries, veins and capillaries. 

    \item How does a frog heart differ from a human heart? Explain a reason for
        this difference.

    A frog heart has 2 atria but only 1 ventricle, whereas the human heart has
    2 atria and 2 ventricle. This is because frogs are amphibian and it's easier
    for them to get oxygen in water than it is for us on land. Therefore their
    circulatory system does not have to be as efficient as that of a human.

\subsection{Reproductive System}
    \item What is the function of the fat bodies?

    Fat bodies are the fat-storage units within a frog's body. They provide
    energy for the frog during hibernation.

    \item How is frog reproduction different from human reproduction?

    Frog lays eggs which hatch into tadpole, which then develops into adult
    frogs. Humans, on the other hand develop within the womb and is born mostly
    developed.

    \item Describe mating in frogs and the stages of frog development.

    All frogs produce sexually, however, almost all frogs, egg fertilization
    happens outside the female's body, with the male releasing the sperm at the
    same time the female releases her eggs. After eggs are fertilized, they
    first hatch into tadpoles, which then slowly transform into adult frogs.

    \item How does the respiratory system change as the frog undergoes
        metamorphosis from a tadpole to an adult frog?

    As a tadpole, the young "frog" has no lung and conducts air exchange solely
    through the skin (as it lives underwater). The metamorphosis causes the
    tadpole to develop a lung.

\subsection{Excretory System}
    \item What are the main structures in both the human and frog excretory
        system?

    Both humans and frogs uses the kidney as their main structure for the
    excretory system. Both uses the method of filtration to cleanse the blood of
    unwanted substances.

    \item What is the function of the kidneys and how does waste from the
        kidneys exit the frog?

    The kidneys filter nitrogenous waste out of the bloodstream of the frog and
    those waste are then transferred to the urinary bladder and are then
    excreted out of the body of the frog.

\subsection{Nervous System}
    \item List 3 structures that are part of a frog’s nervous system.

    3 parts of a frog's nervous system are the brain, the spinal chord and the
    sensory organs.

    \item How is a frog brain different from a human brain?

    First of all, the length of the brain of a frog is 2 cm and the average
    weight is 0.1 g whereas for humans, the average length is approximately 10
    cm. The human brain has a much larger association region that the frog
    brain, which contributes to how humans can make complicated decisions.

\section{Postlab Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the name of the spider web like membrane that covers the
        organs?

    \item Compare the circulation of blood in the heart and lungs for the frog
        and for man. Does a frog need a pulmonary circulation system as
        ``efficient'' as a human? Explain.

    \item Did you find it hard to “straighten” out the digestive tract?
        Explain what you saw holding the digestive tract in its shape.

    \item Compare the relative sizes of the brain lobes of your frog to any
        small mammal and to a human. Do you see a pattern? Explain. You should
        consult a textbook for assistance.

    \item Compare the dissection of the frog to the earthworm.  How did the
    procedures compare? How did the anatomy of the systems compare?

\section*{Introduction}
In F. S. Fitzgerald's iconic novel \underline{The Great Gatsby} describes lives
of the rich in the 1920s. The main character, the famed Mr. Jay Gatsby was
certainly a mysterious celebrity of his time. However, it is tempting to ask,
whether or not he would be considered a celebrity in our age. In the following
case study, we compare the road to fame of three different characters: Steve
Jobs, Barak Obama and Gatsby and see if Gatsby possess the traits that would
make him a celebrity figure today.

\section{Marketing Legend -- Steve Jobs}
One type of celeberties thrive in the bussiness world, often remembered for
their products more than themselves. However, there are a few who have mastered
the art of public relationships and elevated themselves to the status of a
celebrity. One of such people is Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple Inc. In the
following section, we explore his road to fame and the qualities that rise.

\subsection{Road to Fame -- Brief Biography*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Born on 1955, adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs, Paul taught Steve in
        elementary electrical engineering.
    \item 1971 meet Steve Wozniak while attending Homestead High School
    \item 1975 Dropped out of college after six months, sat in on different
        creativity courses.
    \item 1976 started Apple Computers with Steve Wozniak
    \item 1980 Apple Computer became a public traded company, with a market
        value of \$1.2 billion by the end of its very first day of trading.
    \item 1985 Steve Jobs left apple and created a new enterprised called NeXT,
        Inc. and brought an animation company from George Lucas, which later
        became Pixar Animation Studios.
    \item 1996 NeXT brought by apple for \$429 million, Jobs returned to Apple
        as its CEO.

\subsection{Notable Qualities}
In summarizing Steve Job's career to fortune and fame, we can see that his road
to fortune and fame can be attributed to his charisma, creativity and boldness.
For example, his reinvention of the apple's entire marketing scheme, with
special focus on its ease of usage and custumer service are wonderful marketing
schemes that revolutionized marketing ideologies that take serious genious and
bravery to pull off. However, his charisma and genious are not the only things
that contributed to his success, a large part also came from the sheer monetary
power of the Apple Cooperation. A lot of the marketing schemes would not have
been possible without the financial status of Apple Inc. Therefore, his rise to
fortune and fame can be attributed to a combination of his personal charisma as
well as his pre-existing fortune.

\section{Commander in Chief -- Barack Obama}
Another form of celeberties appear in the form of politicans. The principle job
of a politican, or at least what that has became in recent years due to
elections, is the make onself as appealing as possible to the citizens of
America. In this respect, all politicans are in fact, celeberties. In the
following section, we'll discuss how our current president, Barack Obama has
achieved his fame and why that is so.

\subsection{Road to Fame -- Brief Biography*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Born in 1961 in Hawaii, Obama's biological father and mother seperated
        shortly after he was conceived and Obama lived with his mother in
        Hawaii. Obama's parents divorced in 1964, when he was 2.
    \item 1965 Obama's mother married Lolo Soetoro of Indonesia and moved to
        Indonesia a year later. However, several incidents lead Obama's mother
        to send him back to Hawaii to his maternal grandparents.
    \item 1975 Obama enrolled in the esteemed Punahou Academy and graduated in
        1979 excelling in basketball and with academic honors.
    \item After high school, Obama studied at Occidental College in Los
        Angeles for two years.
    \item 1981 Obama transferred to Columbia University and graduated with a

        Obama received a Grammy Award.
    \item 2004 Obama ran and won as the Senator of Illinois, since then he has
        been active in speaking out against the war in Iraq, for healthcare and
        tax reforms, etc.

        Since then he has became the Obama as we know him.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notable Qualities}
Obama's character and intelligence are certainly what mostly attributed to his
success. His was separated from his parents at an early age but he thrived in
school and later as a teacher. We attribute his popular image to his out-going
personality and charismatic speeches. Obama's success in his political career, however,
may also be contributed to his platform, which is frequently more important than
the candidate himself. But even with the power of the platform, it is still his
charisma that ultimately got him into the White House.

\section{The Great Jay Gatsby}
F. S. Fitzgerald's \underline{The Great Gatsby} is arguably one of the most
iconic American novels of all time. Its main character, the legendary and almost
godlike Jay Gatsby, is the ultimate self-made man in literary history. In a lot
of ways, however, his career story and characteristics are not much different
from Obama or Jobs.

\subsection{Road to Fame}
\begin{itemize}
    \item James Gatz was born to a poor German family in the 1890s. (Fitzgerald,
        98)
    \item He quit school (St. Olaf College in Minnesota) and went to Lake
        Superior to seek a career in fishing. (Fitzgerald, 99)
    \item James Gatz saved Dan Cody, a copper tycoon and stayed with him for the
        next ten years to learn the ways of the wealthy. He also changed his
        last name to "Gatsby." (Fitzgerald, 100)
    \item When Cody died, Gatsby was left with a sizable amount of money but
        Cody's mistress cheated Gatsby out of his inheritence.
    \item During WWI, Gatsby reached the rank of Major and was decorated for
        his valor. (Fitzgerald, 150)
    \item After the war Gatsby briefly studied at Trinity College, Oxford.
    \item After returning to the states, Gatsby took advantage of prohibition
        and made loads of money via bootlegging. (Fitzgerald, 151)
    \item Gatsby entered the public light when he brought a mansion on West Egg
        (a part of long island) and started to throw huge parties every week.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notable Qualities}
Gatsby, though not as socially active as Jobs or Obama, but he nevertheless is
very charismatic. For example, Nick Carraway, the narrator of the novel says,
"He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those
rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come
across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole
eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible
prejudice in your favor." (Fitzgerald, 48) This shows that Gatsby has the same charisma
as all of the other discussed celebrities. However, what we also know about
Gatsby is his hard work. Even as a boy he had a strict schedule for himself and
set a goal to aleviate his social status.

\section{Conclusion}
So what does it take to be a celebrity? I would say yes, he possess the charisma
and skills to gain attention and elevate himself in the eyes of the public.
Gatsby would probably be a popular wealthy figure today, large parties are
usually welcomed by the general public and Gatsby's personal charms would
certainly draw people's attention.
